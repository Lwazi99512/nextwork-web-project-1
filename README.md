Welcome to my 7-Day DevOps Challenge project! In this project, I built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using **AWS CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, **S3**, and **GitHub** to deploy a sample web application.

## 🔧 Services I Used

- **AWS CodePipeline** – Orchestrates the flow from source to deployment  
- **AWS CodeBuild** – Compiles source code and produces build artifacts  
- **AWS S3** – Stores build artifacts  
- **AWS CodeDeploy** – Deploys the built application  
- **GitHub** – Hosts the source code and triggers pipeline via webhooks  

## 💡 Key Concepts I Learnt

- Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- Automated Deployments  
- Webhooks and Git version control  
- Multi-stage CI/CD pipeline structure  

## 🛠️ CI/CD Stages Breakdown

### 1. **Source**
- Source code is stored in GitHub.
- Webhooks are used to trigger pipeline runs on new commits.

### 2. **Build**
- CodeBuild compiles the project and generates deployable artifacts.
- Logs and errors are monitored directly in the pipeline dashboard.

### 3. **Deploy**
- CodeDeploy deploys the app to EC2 instances using defined deployment groups.

## ⏱️ Time & Reflection

**This project took me approximately 15 hours.**  
The most challenging part was integrating the services and permissions correctly.  
It was most rewarding to see my code changes auto-deploy to production within seconds!

## ✅ Final Outcome

The moment I pushed my changes to GitHub, the pipeline triggered automatically, and my live app updated in real-time — without any manual intervention. 💥

## 🙋🏽‍♂️ What’s Next?

I’d love to see more advanced tutorials, especially on **large-scale EC2 deployment**, **auto-scaling**, and **load balancing**.
